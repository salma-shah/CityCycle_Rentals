# CityCycle Rentals - Android mobile application

## About
This project is an Android application for CityCycle Rentals. Users can sign up or login into their account. Users can view the available bicycles for reservation and rent, filter them by price, category, and search by location. They can reserve a bicycle for future dates or rent one for different durations, from one hour to a week. This gives the user flexibility to rent bicyclses based on their different needs. Users can manage their rental history and their own account details. While this application does not have payment integration, it is a solid app that makes renting bicycles easy. 

## Built With
* Java
* XML
* SQLite
* Android Studio
* Figma

This was built on Android Studio and can be run on either an emaluator or connected to an Android mobile device. 

The frontend of the application was built using XML elements, while the backend was built using Java. The database was the SQLite database avaiable in the Android Studio environment, and a DBHelper class was created to manage database management related functions. These functions were later called in the Java classes when neccessary. This application follows an Object Oriented Programming approach. 

## Lessons Learned

* This is the first mobile application I built, and it sparked my passion for Java backend related coding.
* I learned how to create the XML layout for each view, by following the wireframe I prepared on Figma.
* I made improvements with the payment options after feedback from my professor. I implemented a new option where users could skip entering their card details if they wanted to simply check out the app. If they did need to make online payments for the rentals, then they could enter their card information.
* This application gave me the opportunity to learn about a different kind of database - the SQLite database, and viewing its tables after running the app on the emaluator.
